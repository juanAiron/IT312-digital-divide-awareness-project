				<p>Despite having 83.8% internet penetration as of early 2025, roughly 16.2% of Filipinos, mostly in
					geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas, remain offline due to infrastructure challenges and
					high costs. While the country boasts near-universal<br> 4G coverage and increasing 5G adoption,
					broadband speeds and service quality still lag behind regional peers.<br />
